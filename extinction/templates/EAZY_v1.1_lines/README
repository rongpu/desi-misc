The first 6 templates are very similar to the eazy_v1.0_lines templates, but
have the PEGASE emission lines *completely* removed and replaced with the Ilbert
line prescription, wherein you estimate a SFR from the template "luminosity" at
2800 A and then use the Kennicutt relations to add emission lines with fixed
line ratios. Now included are Ha, Hb, OIII, OII, and Ly-alpha.

The new last template is an evolved Maraston 2005 SSP (ma05_kr_z02_age10.1.dat),
added because it was found that the reddest EAZY template didn't quite get red
enough for massive old galaxies at z<1.

The included lambda_v1.1.def file should be used with these templates because it
provides sufficient resolution to resolve the narrow emission lines (dLambda
isn't constant).

*** Note that these templates are identical to those in the
    "eazy_v1.0_lines_xx_lya.spectra.param" file, now renamed to help keep
    track of which template set is the recommended version to use.
